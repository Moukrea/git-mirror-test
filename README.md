Yet another Commit from GitHub

## Fork me for your project

Follow the instructions below to fork and rename this template for your own project.

### From GitHub

#### Forking the Repository

1. Go to the GitHub repository URL.
2. Click on the "Fork" button in the upper right corner.
3. In the resulting dialog, select your GitHub username to copy the repository to your personal space.

#### Renaming Your Fork

1. Navigate to your new fork on GitHub.
2. Under the repository name, click "Settings".
3. In the "Repository name" field, type the new name of your repository.
4. Scroll down and click "Rename".

#### Updating Your Fork from the Original Repository

To keep your fork up to date with the changes from the original repository:

1. In your forked repository, click on `Fetch upstream`.
2. Click `Fetch and merge` to merge the latest changes from the original repository into your fork.

### From GitLab

#### Forking the Mirrored Repository

1. Navigate to the GitLab mirror of the original GitHub repository.
2. Click on the "Fork" button.
3. Choose where to fork the repository (e.g., your personal namespace).

#### Renaming Your Fork

1. Go to your forked project on GitLab.
2. Click on "Settings" > "General".
3. Expand the "Project name, project slug, repository, and visibility" section.
4. Change the "Project name" and "Project slug" as needed.
5. Scroll down and click "Save changes".

#### Updating Your Fork from the GitLab Mirror

To update your fork with the latest changes from the mirrored repository on GitLab, follow these steps:

1. On your local machine, navigate to the directory of your cloned fork.
2. Fetch the changes from the GitLab mirror:
   ```bash
   git fetch <MIRRORED_REPOSITORY_URL> main
   ```
3. Check out your local main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```
4. Merge the fetched changes into your local main branch:
   ```bash
   git merge FETCH_HEAD
   ```
5. Resolve any merge conflicts that may arise.
6. Push the merged changes to your fork on GitLab:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

Replace `<MIRRORED_REPOSITORY_URL>` with the URL of the GitLab mirror repository, and `main` with the name of the branch you're updating if different.

This will keep your fork updated with the latest changes from the mirrored repository.
```

Ensure that you replace `<ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY_URL>` and `<MIRRORED_REPOSITORY_URL>` with the actual URLs of the original and mirrored repositories, respectively. This markdown includes all the steps needed for a user to fork, rename, and keep their project updated.
